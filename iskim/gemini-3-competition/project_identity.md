## 📝 5W1H Analysis

| 5W1H                 | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| :------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Why (Effect)**     | **Problem**: Managing leftovers is boring; food waste is a global issue. <br> **Insight**: People love leveling up in games but hate "admin work" in real life. <br> **Goal**: Inject dopamine into sustainability.      |
| **Who (Target)**     | Gen Z/Millennials who grew up with games, households trying to reducing waste, and anyone bored with standard "utility apps".                                                                                            |
| **What (Product)**   | A web app where your fridge is the "Dungeon" and ingredients are "Loot". <br> _Features_: Video Scan -> Pixel Item Inventory -> Recipe Quests.                                                                           |
| **How (Tech)**       | **Gemini 3 Pro Multimodality**: Recognizes objects in video. <br> **Reasoning (System 2)**: Creative roleplay (Apple -> "Orb of Wisdom") + Logic (Recipe generation). <br> **Vibe Coding**: Built entirely in AI Studio. |
| **Where (Platform)** | Built & Hosted in **Google AI Studio**.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **When (Timing)**    | The era of "Vibe Coding" where the barrier between idea and app is zero.                                                                                                                                                 |

## 🏆 Winning Strategy: Mapping to Judging Criteria

### 1. Impact (40%) - "Solves a Real Problem"

- **Our Angle**: "Gamification for Sustainability".
- **Argument**: Most food waste apps fail because they feel like homework. BitBites works because it's _fun_. We use AI to change human behavior (Behavioral Design).

### 2. Technical Depth (30%) - "Does it utilize Gemini 3?"

- **Our Angle**: "Beyond labelling".
- **Strength**: We don't just ask "What is this?". We ask:
  1.  What is this? (Video Vision)
  2.  What is its 'RPG' archetype? (Creative Reasoning)
  3.  What can I make with it that fits a 'Quest' theme? (Complex Context)
- _Competitor Comparison_: Others just tag images. We transform context.

### 3. Creativity (20%) - "Originality"

- **Our Angle**: "Genre-bending".
- **Strength**: Mixing **Utility** (Pantry Tracker) with **Gaming** (RPG). The 8-bit aesthetic visually differentiates us from the sea of "clean corporate AI dashboards".

### 4. Presentation (10%) - "Wow Factor"

- **Our Angle**: "Nostalgia".
- **Strategy**: The demo video will start with boring reality (grey filter), then "GLITCH" into vibrant 8-bit pixel art when Gemini activates. Sound effects (coin sounds) are crucial.

## 🔑 Key Narrative (Elevator Pitch)

"We used Gemini 3 Pro not just to see the world, but to **re-imagine** it. BitBites proves that AI can do more than analyze data—it can make our daily lives more magical. It turns the chore of saving the planet into a quest for loot."
