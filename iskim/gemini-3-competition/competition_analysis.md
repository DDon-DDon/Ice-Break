# Gemini 3 Pro Competition Analysis

## Overview

- **Event**: Vibe Code with Gemini 3 Pro Hackathon
- **Platform**: Google AI Studio (Build tab)
- **Model**: Gemini 3 Pro (Preview)
- **Goal**: Build "impossible to build yesterday" applications that solve daily frustrations or global challenges.
- **Deadline**: Friday, December 12, 2025 (11:59 PM UTC) - _Very tight timeline!_

## Key Themes / Tracks

1. **Science**: Accelerate discovery/research.
2. **Education**: Reimagine learning.
3. **Accessibility**: Tools for everyone.
4. **Health**: Improve lives/patient care.
5. **Business**: Reinvent workflows.
6. **Technology**: Push boundaries of code.

## Evaluation Criteria (The "Winning Formula")

1.  **Impact (40%)**: Solves a real-world problem. Tangible positive change. **(Most important)**
2.  **Technical Depth & Execution (30%)**: Does it work? Usage of Multimodality, Reasoning, Context. Real engineering, not smoke and mirrors.
3.  **Creativity (20%)**: Originality. New ways of using Gemini 3.
4.  **Presentation (10%)**: "Wow" factor in the video. Storytelling.

## Submission Requirements

1.  **Kaggle Writeup**: Title, subtitle, thumbnail, 250-word description.
2.  **Video Demo**: Max 2 mins. Must be public (YouTube/X/Loom).
3.  **Public AI Studio App Link**: Working interactive demo.

## Strategic Constraints & Opportunities

- **Time**: We have very few days left (Deadline Dec 12).
- **Tooling**: Must use AI Studio "Build". "Vibe coding" implies rapid prototyping using natural language prompts to generate the app.
- **Focus**: "Vibe coding" suggests we shouldn't get bogged down in manual boilerplate. We need to lean heavily on Gemini to write the code for us within the Studio.

## "Sequential Thinking" for Direction

To maximize score:

- **Optimization**: Focus on _Impact_ + _Technical Depth_.
- **Differentiation**: Use _Native Multimodality_ (Audio/Video/Image inputs) + _Reasoning_. Don't just make a text chatbot.
